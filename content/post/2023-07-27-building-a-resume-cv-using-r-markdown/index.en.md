# Background

While I'll likely continue to use word to build my resume, I wanted to take a stab at building a resume while leveraging R Markdowns. There are plenty of blog posts available when searching Google for 'make a resume in r' so I thought it would be a fun challenge. Besides, there were some great ideas online about leveraging csv files in order to maintain the resume online that could be beneficial.
